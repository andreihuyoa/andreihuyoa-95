              I&apos;m a {age} year old Computer Science Student at day and a gamer at night!
              Creating fun and impactful software that serves me and people around me is my drive
              and passion.
            </p>
            <p>
              I love staying up to date with the latest tech trends and development frameworks
              across all platforms. While I normally dwell in app design and development, I also
              love development in different platforms.
            </p>
            <p>
              At 21, for our thesis we along with my co-student at Adamson University made
              Lokalista. It gained the attention of our computer science department, earning an
              invitation to present and showcase our program at our Adamson University&apos;s Neo
              Science and Technology Incubation Center (AduNest) annual Incubation Camp.
            </p>
            <p>
              I always look forward to collaborate and gain experience with companies, and people in
              diverse fields, including (but not limited toüòπ) e-commerce, art, and design
              industries.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my spare time, I enjoy listening to music and read my books in my room, which helps
              me to unwind.
