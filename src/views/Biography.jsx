              {/* Make this age auto update! */}
              I&apos;m a {age} year old Computer Science Student who&apos;s a god at day but a gamer
              at night! Crafting impactful software that serves my community and people around me is
              my passion
            </p>
            <p>
              I thrive on staying updated with the latest tech trends and development frameworks
              across all platforms. While my heart lies in app design and development, I also excel
              in cross-platform app and web development, which keeps the bills paid.
            </p>
            <p>
              At 21, I co-founded Lokalista along with my co-student from the Philippines. Since
              then, it has garnered attention, being featured on our school AduNest (Adamson
              University Neo Science and Technology Incubation Center), &apos;s annual Incubation
              Camp, and earning a nomination from Apple&apos;s regional team for their annual design
              awards.
            </p>
            <p>
              Having collaborated with diverse companies worldwide, from e-commerce to art and
              design industries, I&apos;ve honed the ability to manage multiple projects
              simultaneously across various time zones.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my spare time, I indulge in scrolling through analog camera listings or admiring my
              collection, although shooting has taken a backseat due to my various work commitments.
